# Prediction of diagnosis of Cervical Cancer  using ML
 Cervical cancer poses a significant global health challenge, profoundly impacting the lives of
 women and their families [1]. This malignancy originates in the cervix, the lower part of the
 uterus that connects to the vagina, primarily as a result of persistent infection with specific
 strains of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Regions with restricted access to healthcare
 services are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of cervical cancer. Although there have been
 notable advances in medical science, particularly in the early detection of the disease, the
 promise of effective HPV vaccines for prevention is substantial [3]. Despite these strides, the
 importance of awareness campaigns, regular screenings, and vaccination efforts cannot be
 overstated. The timely and accurate diagnosis of cervical cancer is crucial for initiating prompt
 treatment and achieving better outcomes. However, barriers such as limited access to healthcare
 persist, especially in resource-constrained areas [2]. Recognizing the persistent challenges, the
 integration of machine learning into cervical cancer screening processes has the potential to
 significantly enhance efficiency, particularly in regions with limited resources. This
 technological approach holds the promise of saving lives through the early detection and
 intervention of cervical cancer.
